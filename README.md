# My portfolio site
During the second semester of study, I had the pleasure to participate in a subject that aimed to familiarize me with Internet technologies. 
The scope of the subject ended with JS and PHP, so I decided that I would take myself and start moving the page made during classes to React.js. 
The entire page has been written only on the basis of React and GSAP documentation.

## Stack:
- create-react-app
- React, hooks
- GSAP3
- fullpage.js
- github-pages deployment

###### total refactor needed :/
